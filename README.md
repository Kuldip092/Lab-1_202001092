# Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

# Scope:

This application is made for users who have lost their hearing.
It provides features by which this user can also apply to recognizing the sound.
This can be very useful for a community of people who can’t hear at all.

# Features:

It should have a user/password interface at the first.
The system displays words or sentences on the mobile screen when there is sound around it or the user wants to hear sound which he/she is not able to hear with ears.
The application uses artificial intelligence to recognize sounds and displays so the user can see and realize what is this sound.
If the sound is dangerous like car horns or any other sound which can harm the user then the application vibrates without even opening it. 
It should have a voice assistant operated application.
It should have an option where we can add a sound and define the sound in our own ways. Whenever this type of sound or similar to this sound is around it should recognize it and can show the user about it.

# Non-Functional requirements:

The application should immediately recognize the sound and give an immediate alert to the user by vibrating or any other way if the sound seems very dangerous.
It should be working properly all the time.
It should not be very costly so every type of user can use it.
It should have a very user-friendly interface because most of its users will be old.
